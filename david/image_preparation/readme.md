for correct work your **data folder** must include 2 subfolders:
1. **generated** (e.g. _C:\Users\singe\Desktop\training\generated_)
    * this subfolder also must include 2 subfolders with **training** images:
        * **cats**
        * **dogs**
2. **test** (e.g. _C:\Users\singe\Desktop\training\test_)
    * this subfolder also must include 2 subfolders with **validating** images:
        * **cats**
        * **dogs**
        
in both folders will be created pickles **subfolder** with normalized data
